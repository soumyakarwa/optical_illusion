# optical_illusion
I wanted to create something very simple but beautiful. I thought to make the message "hidden in plain sight" the same color
as the background and create some sort of brush stroke following mouseX, mousseY to illuminate the text. I also wanted to
experiment working with CSS/HTML in addition to p5.js and JavaScript, so I decided to do a dark and light mode switch.
